##  ‚úÖ When to Use Builder Pattern
	‚Ä¢	When you have a complex object with many optional parameters.
	‚Ä¢	When object creation involves a multi-step process.
	‚Ä¢	When constructors with many parameters are becoming hard to manage (telescoping constructors).



## Real life example 
Imagine you‚Äôre ordering a custom burger at a restaurant. You might choose:
	‚Ä¢	Type of bun
	‚Ä¢	Type of patty
	‚Ä¢	Toppings
	‚Ä¢	Sauces
	‚Ä¢	Cheese

Each customer can customize it differently. The builder pattern helps create such a custom object step-by-step.


## ‚úÖ Advantages
	‚Ä¢	Improves code readability and maintainability.
	‚Ä¢	Avoids large telescoping constructors.
	‚Ä¢	Makes object creation more flexible and testable.
	‚Ä¢	You can reuse the builder for creating similar objects.

## ‚ùå Disadvantages
	‚Ä¢	More boilerplate code.
	‚Ä¢	Not ideal for very simple objects.


## üõ† Builder Pattern in Libraries
	‚Ä¢	StringBuilder in Java is a real-world usage.
	‚Ä¢	Lombok @Builder annotation simplifies it.
	‚Ä¢	Common in libraries like Jackson (for JSON) and builders for HTTP clients.
